This tool adds tooltips to PDF files exported from Visio. The tool provides a simple solution
for transferring 'Comments' from your Visio file shapes into PDF. Update both your PDF and 
the original Visio file, and the tool will handle the rest.

Your files are securely processed and are not stored after processing anywhere.

If you prefer an offline solution, get our Visio Add-In for offline processing from the <a href="https://unmanagedvisio.com/products/visio-pdf-export-with-tooltips" target="_blank"><strong>UnmanagedVisio.com</strong></a> website.
This nifty tool allows you to add tooltips to your PDF files without the need for an internet connection.
