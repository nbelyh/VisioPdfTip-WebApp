Effortlessly add tooltips to your PDF files exported from Visio. The tool provides a simple solution
for transferring 'Comments' from your Visio file shapes into your PDF. To get started, all you need to
do is upload both your PDF and the original Visio file, and our servers handle the rest.

We value your privacy. Your files are securely processed on our servers and are not stored
post-processing.

If you prefer an offline solution, we've got you covered. Purchase our Visio Add-In for offline
processing from <a href="https://unmanagedvisio.com/products/visio-pdf-export-with-tooltips" target="_blank"><strong>our website</strong></a>.
This nifty tool allows you to add tooltips to your PDF files without the need for an internet connection.
