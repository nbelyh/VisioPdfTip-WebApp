# Chipher File Tool

This tool allows you to chipher the content of the Visio diagram. 
It analyzes the Visio file and chiphers all text and shape content, according to the selected chiphering options.

If you prefer an offline solution, get the  Super Utilities Visio Add-In for offline processing from the <a href="https://unmanagedvisio.com/products/vsu" target="_blank"><strong>UnmanagedVisio.com</strong></a> website.
