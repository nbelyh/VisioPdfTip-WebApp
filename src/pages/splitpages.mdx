# Visio Split File Tool

This tool allows you to split one Visio file into multiple Visio files.

Simply drag and drop your Visio VSDX file and this tool will provide the set of pages as separate pages in a ZIP archive.

Your files are securely processed and are not stored after processing anywhere.

If you prefer an offline solution, get the  Super Utilities Visio Add-In for offline processing from the <a href="https://unmanagedvisio.com/products/vsu" target="_blank"><strong>UnmanagedVisio.com</strong></a> website.

This tool is open source, check out the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/nbelyh/VisioWebTools)
