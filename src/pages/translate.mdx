# Translate File Tool

This tool allows you to translate the content of the Visio diagram. The tool uses OpenAI GPT-4O-MINI model 
to translate the text. The tool will try to translate the text as close as possible to the original text.
By default, the size of the translation is limited to 1000 tokens. If you need to translate more text, you can
bring your own OpenAI key and use the full power of the model. You can get your OpenAI key by signing up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

Please report issues to our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nbelyh/VisioWebTools/issues)
