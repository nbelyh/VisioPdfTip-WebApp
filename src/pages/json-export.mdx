# Export JSON Tool

This tool allows you to generate plain JSON from the diagram file content. The tool will analyze the Visio file and generate a JSON representation of the content. 
The JSON will include all the shapes and their properties, as well as the connections between the shapes.

Please report issues to our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nbelyh/VisioWebTools/issues)
