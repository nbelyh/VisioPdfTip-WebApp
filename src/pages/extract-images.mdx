# Visio Media Extraction Tool

This tool allows you to extract images, embedded into Visio diagram, in their original format.
It analyzes the Visio file and extracts all embedded images into a ZIP archive.
Each image is prefixed with page and shape id where it's used, so it is possible to find the image in the Visio file.

Simply drag and drop your Visio VSDX file and this tool will provide the extracted media files (images) as a ZIP archive.

Your files are securely processed and are not stored after processing anywhere.

Please report issues to our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nbelyh/VisioWebTools/issues)
