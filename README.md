Collection of tools to work with Visio files (online)

## PdfTip WebApp

The Visio PdfTip Add-In is an online tool that lets you add info boxes to your PDFs from Visio. By uploading both your PDF and the original Visio file, the tool automatically adds comments from Visio shapes into the PDF. So, when someone views the PDF, they can hover over shapes to see extra info. This makes the PDF more interactive and informative.
